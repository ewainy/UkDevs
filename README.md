# Uk Devs 🇬🇧

Hello my lovelies 😊

Me & Coner created the UK Devs discord in Summer 2021 as a way to find and keep connected with fellow Brits in tech from the tech Twitter community 🐦

Everyone knows what I'm like, I talk to absolutely everyone, I just wanted my favourite people in one place 😂 

So I began inviting people to the discord that we both spoke to regularly and then I began to keep an eye on who was naturally talking to eachother on twitter and inviting them to join too! So that we could have a close group made up of friends 🥰

This has grown (and continues to do so) and it's been absolutely incredible, Im super proud to see all the support and engagement in this group!! 

Going forward though, my thoughts are that there are so many warm, positive and helpful people on Twitter that I would like to propose a change...

<h2>💜 That we change the group name and focus 💜 </h2>

That it isn't limited to just the UK and that it isn't limited just to developers, but to tech as a whole!

Let me know your thoughts, I will be <b>opening a discussion for the *renaming* of the group </b>and would love for everyone to drop suggestions - whether this be words (such as tech, digital) or name suggestions. Once we can decide on a name as a group, I will then create a GitHub organization for our community and I will open up more discussions. 


Peace ✌ Love 💖 Light ✨
